 Zoom and Slack are the communication platforms used for discussion on the project. Meetings are conducted almost daily to assign project tasks, decide on technologies to be used and solve any challenges encountered during the process.

 ## Technologies Used
 Zoom and Slack are the communication platforms used for discussion on the project. Meetings are conducted several times a week to assign project tasks, decide on technologies to be used and solve any challenges encountered during the process.

 ## Provisional Machine Learning Model

 Python Libraries, PySpark and Google Collab will be used for machine learning. We will use a supervised learning model. See the xxx notebook for the provisional machine learning model. 
 Python Libraries, PySpark and Google Collab will be used for machine learning. 

 We will use a supervised learning model. In this example, we are experimenting with SMOTE. This is one of the models we will review before determining which one(s) we will use:

 ## Provisional Database 

 Here is a sample of the review table data:

 ## Data Cleaning and Analysis

 Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using PySpark.
