# Restaurant Business Analysis

## Purpose of the Project 

This project will use Machine Learning Algorithms and models to predict the star rating of a restaurant based on features such as food served, noise level, location, price range, etc and also predict the success of a restaurant based on its features. Different Machine Learning models are trained and evaluated to predict the model with the highest accuracy. 

## Reason Why We Selected Our Topic

With this project, we want to be able to help people search the best restaurants in a particular category in a particular city.

## Description of the Source of Data

The Dataset came from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). It contains 5 different json data files out of which we are just taking the ```business.json```

- The ```business.json``` file contains business data including location data, attributes, categories and star ratings for the restaurants.

## Questions to be Answered With the Data

- What Features makes a Restaurant successful?
- Can we accurately classify a restaurant by star ratings given these features?
- Can we accurately predict the success of a restaurant given these features?

## Communication Protocols

```Zoom``` and ```Slack``` are the communication platforms used for discussion on the project. Meetings are conducted several times a week to assign project tasks, decide on technologies to be used and solve any challenges encountered during the process.

## Machine Learning Model

We have been entertaining the idea of incorporating a Neural Network to predict the star rating of a restaurant based on features such as food served, noise level, location etc. The second viable option in mind is to create a model predicting the success of a restaurant based on these same features or attributes utilizing a Logistic regression. Information for Both Models as well as a README.md is located in the link provided below

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Python Pandas,sklearn, and tensorflow libraries will be used to clean the data,perform an exploratory analysis, and build our Machine learning models.

## Requirements.txt
We set up a requirements.txt file in the root folder. This file contains what packages and libraries are needed to successfully run the code.

## Dashboard

Tableau will be used to create interactive dashboards.
